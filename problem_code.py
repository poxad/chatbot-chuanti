            ### Description:
            Provide a short description of the objective of the problem, focusing on what the user needs to achieve. Avoid excessive details, keeping it concise and clear.

            - Clearly define the input format, breaking it down by each operation or command.
            - Clearly define the expected output format, specifying any edge cases or conditions where no output might be required.
